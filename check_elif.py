# The elif statement: checks additional conditions if the previous if or elif conditions are not met

# if condition1:
    # Code to be executed if condition1 is True
# elif condition2:
    # Code to be executed if condition1 is False and condition2 is True

# Example
# age = 28

# if age >= 18:
#     print("You are eligible to vote.")
# elif age >= 16:
#     print("You can get a learner's driving license.")


# Another Example
x = 9

if x < 5:
    print("x is less than 5")
elif x < 10:
    print("x is between 5 and 9")
elif x < 15:
    print("x is between 10 and 14")
